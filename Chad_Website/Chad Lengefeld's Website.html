 <h2> About me </h2>
 Currently Employed at Indeed via Staffmark, working on the Indeed Prime product. I am always searching for a challenge and consider myself a dynamic individual who enjoys
 technology, nature, science, and how systems interact in all kinds of ways throughout our lives. My interests are all over the place, from cryptocurrency 
 and blockchain technology most recently, to over fifteen years of research and experience with nutrition, physiology, and the pursuit of physical 
 and mental excellence.
Let's have a chat, I've got a world of knowledge to share and I'd love to learn something from you.
